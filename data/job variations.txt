			`The spaceport is a flurry of activity, over a dozen combat ships are being prepped for launch, others are already taking off. "Captain <last>?" You turn to see a serious looking senior Deep Security officer. "A gigantic pirate armada, one of the biggest we've seen, is converging on this sytem and expected to arrive any moment now. We have a large Deep Security fleet about to arrive to assist but we will still not match the pirate fleet in numbers. Would you be willing to help?"`

			`As combat ships continue to launch with an alarming disregard for safety checklists, the officer continues, "The hostile fleets total at least ten heavy warships, several marauders, and dozens of smaller craft. They are currently incoming from varying locations and the first will be arriving any moment, as will our own reinforcements. Take off immediately and prepare for the assault. Good luck!"`

			`As you make ready for a quick launch, you hear a voice call "I've got your back Captain!" The voice is coming from a young and inexperienced looking merchant captain with aviator sunglasses, standing near a shiny new Bactrian.`
			`"My dad just bought me this and it needs to see some action, what better way than to fight with the famous Captain <last>" "Are you insane?" you reply, "Several dozen pirate ships are about to blockade this system, this is not a fight for a novice."`
			`The merchant captain grins and says "Yeah well I like to live on the wild side. See you up there!"`
			
			`You don't have a good feeling about this.`
