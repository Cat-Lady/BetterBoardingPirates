WIP

Overall goal is to make Human space combat more interesting and challenging in the mid-late game.

Current features:

- Progressively introduces Hai+limited korath technology, and the Kestrel, and then finally Hai/Korath fitted Kestrels, into existing ambient pirate/merchant fleets, Marauder mission targets, 15+ brand new combat missions, and the Marauder Bounty Hunted fleet (that Marauder fleet that hunts you down occasionally) as the player progresses through the game.

- These additions are done in line with the story - Pirate kestrels start appearing (in ambient fleets and as targets) when you unlock the Kestrel, and they appear with outfits corresponding to your Kestrel design choice. ie if you choose weapons, you're gonna see 18 gun pirate kestrels! Alien tech Marauders will only appear once you complete main storyline, and alien tech Kestrels added once you've completed both.

- Adds 15+ high end combat missions such as new Planetary Defence, Destroy Nearby Blockade and Fleet Hunt jobs in human space, complete with corresponding regional NPC assistance in many cases (more incoming)

- Two new invisible "Marauder Hunted" missions involving very large fleets that will hunt you down.

- 10+ Marauder variants (existing pirate ships with new outfit combinations)

- 15 Kestrel variants (5 for each Kestrel design choice)



- Adds a wide range of



 and is focused on adding difficult and varied high end combat missions in human space complete with regional NPC assistance, as well as adding a wide variety of pirate ship variants as the player progresses through the game.

including the Kestrel and alien tech fit Marauders, into ambient NPC fleets and mission targets, and introducing much more challenging and varied late game combat missions in human space (for now).

It is designed to be quite difficult at times even for large fleets so take care.

PLEASE make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin.

To test fully, use a pilot with the Kestrel missions completed and a combat rating of 12 or higher to see the all the new "invisible" bounty hunter missions.

Go to human space, frontier worlds especially (for many of the spaceport missions) and check out the job board, and spam spaceport, but watch out for the new bounty hunters coming after you :D The spaceport missions involve friendly NPC fleet assistance corresponding to your location.

- Adds 15 kestrel variants (5 for each design choice, of these 4 human and 1 Hai)
- If/when player completes Kestrel missions, adds variants corresponding to your design choice to various NPC fleets with very low spawn rate, and creates new Marauder fleet(s) using said kestrel variants and other existing Marauders, and uses them in the missions below.
- Adds two hidden "Bounty Hunter" missions, similar to the existing but more difficult (more variety on these soon)
- Adds 12+ new high end spaceport combat missions including region-specific NPC fleet assistance (many more incoming soon)
- Adds three new high end Bounty Hunter jobs (more incoming)

Working on adding the following:

- Lots of late game high end combat missions from spaceport + job board including fleet interception, raids, system blockades, random chance escalations (pirate traps) and more
- A super wide range of variants for many pirate ships, since some pirates I feel should have questionable, cobbled together outfits
