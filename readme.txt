WIP

Overall goal is to make combat in Human space much more interesting and challenging in the mid-late game.
No new weapons/ships are added, all the content here is made from vanilla.

I made this because:

- The kestrel is beautiful and I want to see more of it while playing the game.

- Human space combat missions (spaceport and jobs) currently don't scale very well into the late game, they aren't very good $$ and are somewhat boring once you obtain a large fleet.

- I think pirate ships and merchant ships should use a bigger variety of weapon/engine/tech combinations, especially after the main storyline is completed.

- I want Bounty Hunters to be properly scary even for players with large fleets, and scale hard with combat rating.



Current features:

- Progressively introduces Hai+limited korath technology, and the Kestrel, and then finally Hai/Korath fitted Kestrels, into existing ambient pirate/merchant fleets, Marauder mission targets, 15+ brand new combat missions, and the Marauder Bounty Hunted fleet (that Marauder fleet that hunts you down occasionally) as the player progresses through the game.

- These additions are done in line with the story - Pirate kestrels start appearing (in ambient fleets and as targets) when you unlock the Kestrel, and they appear with outfits corresponding to your Kestrel design choice. ie if you choose weapons, you're gonna see 18 gun pirate kestrels! Alien tech Marauders will only appear once you complete main storyline, and alien tech Kestrels added once you've completed both.

- Adds 15+ high end combat missions such as new Planetary Defence, Destroy Nearby Blockade and Fleet Hunt jobs in human space, complete with corresponding regional NPC assistance in many cases (more incoming)

- Two new invisible "Marauder Hunted" missions involving very large fleets that will hunt you down.

- 10+ Marauder variants (existing pirate ships with new outfit combinations)

- 15 Kestrel variants (5 for each Kestrel design choice)

***To test fully, use a pilot with the Kestrel missions completed and a combat rating of 12 or higher. Head to Human space, especially "frontier" systems, and spam spaceport/check job board.

It is designed to be quite difficult at times even for large-ish fleets so take care.

PLEASE make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin.



Working on adding the following:

- Lots of late game high end combat missions from spaceport + job board including fleet interception, raids, system blockades, random chance escalations (pirate traps) and more
- A super wide range of variants for many more pirate ships, since some pirates I feel should have questionable, cobbled together outfits
