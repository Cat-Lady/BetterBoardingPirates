WIP. This plugin does not contain any new weapons/ships/sprites, it is designed to feel as vanilla as possible.

The overall goal is to make combat jobs/missions in Human space more varied, interesting and scale better into the late game, and to add a lot more variety to NPC fleets (both pirate and merchant) in general. Also to add the Kestrel, and alien tech outfitted pirates, to missions, ambient fleets (both pirate and others) and bounty hunter fleets. All the changes described are made in line with regular progression through the storyline as described below.


Current features:

- Progressively introduces Hai+limited korath outfits, and the Kestrel, and then finally Hai/Korath fitted Kestrels, into ambient pirate/merchant fleets, Marauder mission targets, 15+ brand new combat missions, and the Marauder Bounty Hunted fleet (that Marauder fleet that hunts you down occasionally).

- These additions are done in line with the story - Pirate kestrels start appearing (in ambient fleets and as targets) when you unlock the Kestrel, and they appear in the form corresponding to your Kestrel design choice and with custom outfits ie if you choose weapons, you're gonna see a host of different 18 gun pirate kestrels! Alien tech Marauders will only appear once you complete main storyline, and alien tech Kestrels added once you've completed both.

- Introduces pirates in various ships they don't normally use, such as the Protector, Dreadnought, Cruiser and more, after main story completion

- Adds 15+ high end combat missions such as new Planetary Defence, Destroy Nearby Blockade and Fleet Hunt jobs in human space, complete with corresponding regional NPC assistance in many cases (more incoming)

- Two new invisible "Marauder Hunted" missions involving very large fleets that will hunt you down.

- 10+ new Marauder variants (existing pirate ships with new outfit combinations)

- 15 Kestrel variants (5 for each Kestrel design choice)

***To test fully, use a pilot with the Kestrel missions completed and a combat rating of 12 or higher. Head to Human space, and spam spaceport/check job board. Watch out for the new Bounty Hunted fleets coming to hunt you down!

It is designed to be quite difficult at times even for large-ish fleets so take care.

PLEASE make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin.



Working on adding the following:

- Lots of late game high end combat missions from spaceport + job board including fleet interception, raids, system blockades, random chance escalations (pirate traps) and more
- much more NPC ship/outfit combination variety
