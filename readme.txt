Very much WIP from super noob attempting first plugin, feedback much appreciated

PLEASE make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin.

- Adds 15 kestrel variants (5 for each design choice, of these 4 human and 1 Hai)
- If/when player completes Kestrel missions, adds the variants corresponding to your design choice to various NPC fleets with very low spawn rate, and creates new Marauder fleet(s) using said kestrel variants and other existing Marauders
- Adds hidden "Bounty Hunter" mission, similar to the existing but more difficult (more variety on these soon)
- Adds two spaceport combat jobs (many more incoming soon)

Working on adding the following:

- Lots of late game high end combat missions from spaceport + job board including fleet interception, raids, system blockades, random chance escalations (pirate traps) and more
- A super wide range of variants for many pirate ships, since some pirates I feel should have questionable, cobbled together outfits
