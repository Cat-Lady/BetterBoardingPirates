This plugin is focused on adding more pirate outfit variety, including the Kestrel, into ambient NPC fleets and mission targets, and introducing much more challenging and varied late game combat missions in human space (for now). Very much WIP from super noob attempting first plugin, feedback much appreciated

PLEASE make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin.

To test fully, use a pilot with the Kestrel missions completed and a combat rating of 9 or higher, or 11 and higher to see the all the new "invisible" bounty hunter missions.

- Adds 15 kestrel variants (5 for each design choice, of these 4 human and 1 Hai)
- If/when player completes Kestrel missions, adds variants corresponding to your design choice to various NPC fleets with very low spawn rate, and creates new Marauder fleet(s) using said kestrel variants and other existing Marauders, and uses them in the missions below.
- Adds two hidden "Bounty Hunter" missions, similar to the existing but more difficult (more variety on these soon)
- Adds six new high end spaceport combat missions (many more incoming soon)
- Adds three new high end Bounty Hunter jobs (more incoming)

Working on adding the following:

- Lots of late game high end combat missions from spaceport + job board including fleet interception, raids, system blockades, random chance escalations (pirate traps) and more
- A super wide range of variants for many pirate ships, since some pirates I feel should have questionable, cobbled together outfits
