[h1]This plugin is a part of upcoming "Endless Sky: Captain's Edition" reboot of the base game. Stay tuned - meanwhile, installing the plugins can help to preview the experience, together or in parts.[/h1]

This plugin integrates [url=https://github.com/ZBok/BetterVanillaPirates]BetterVanillaPirates[/url] by [url=https://github.com/ZBok]Zbok[/url] with [url=https://github.com/Cat-Lady/Boarding-Enhancements]Boarding Enhancements[/url]]. It fully integrates new outfits (from the latter) into fleets and ship variants (added by the former).

...is required for this plugin to work.



[h1]Features[/h1]

[list][*]8 new types of gear used during boarding - ranging from Dirt Belt's hunting rifles and small sidearms, to full fledged Navy's Advanced Tactical Battle Suit.

[*]2 ship's outfits that greatly increase battle readiness of crew stationed aboard vessel's sporting them.

[*]Full and seamless integration into rest of the BetterVanillaPirates plugin. AI ships use it - progressively integrating more numerous and powerful outfits as certain in-game war event unfolds - and overall, strong gear is in possession of forces that you would expect them to do so (be sure to expect certain renegade warlords to be armed to teeth).

[*]For the first time in [i][b]Endless Sky[/b][/i] - quasi-random distribution of boarding outfits on AI controlled ships. Even when meeting "same" or similarly constructed fleet, you can never be sure if you will encounter only token defense or full-fledged boarding regiment (especially on warships) - or, anything in between. 
[b]Hint:[/b] As an effect, "Outfit Scanner" becomes much more useful thing to have. Knowing what you expect might now be a difference between choosing vulnerable targets and diving head-on into suicidal boarding attempt.

[*]As indirect effect, boarding military/marauder targets or well-defended merchant fleets is now much more challenging... But also, much more rewarding, if you are prepared and act wisely.
