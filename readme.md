# Better Pirates Upgrade for Endless Sky (nightly build)

This plugin is designed to enhance/improve/fill gaps in many aspects of pirate combat, especially in the late-game. It does not contain any new weapons/ships/sprites, or any new or replacement storylines. It achieves this by the adding the following:

- 25+ new combat missions (jobs and spaceport) with tonnes of variety and unusual low-chance variations in human space, complete with corresponding regional NPC assistance in many cases (more incoming). These new missions range multiple wave planetary defence, pirate blockade destruction and more. They range from 1mil to 20mil payouts, but the toughest jobs require extremely expensive fleets to complete without losses. The most difficult of these involve low-chance unusual variations with extra NPC assistance! Some of these involve gigantic fleet battles so take care!

- Progressively introduces Hai+limited Korath outfits, and the Kestrel, and then finally Hai/Korath fitted Kestrels, into ambient pirate/merchant fleets, mission targets (as  described above), and the Marauder Bounty Hunted fleet (that Marauder fleet that hunts you down occasionally).

- Introduces pirates in ships they don't normally use, such as the Protector, Vanguard, Osprey, Aerie, Mule, in correct regions. Pirates in military ships including Dreadnought, Skein, Frigate, Gunboat are added after main story completion. You'll see these extremely rarely in ambient fleets and as mission targets. (potentially more incoming)

- Three new invisible "Marauder Hunted" missions involving very large fleets that will hunt you down.

- 10+ new Marauder variants (existing pirate ships with new outfit combinations) used in missions and bounty hunter fleets

- 15 Kestrel variants (5 for each Kestrel design choice)

## How does this actually change my game?

- With this plugin installed, your game will be completely vanilla everywhere early game, except you'll see pirates in more ships that they don't use in vanilla, like Aerie/Mule/Vanguard (no military ships yet).

- Once your combat rating gets past 9 (or if it is already), you'll start to see much more difficult combat jobs/spaceport missions, over 25 region specific variations, all over human space, vs new pirate fleet compositions. These missions, while already super varied, will see more variation in pirate ships and outfits as the main FW storyline and kestrel missions are completed, more detail on that below. The most difficult jobs also have low-chance variations with extra cool NPC assistance :D

- As your combat rating continues to increase, tougher and more varied Bounty Hunter fleets will hunt you down, and as above, these fleets become more varied with player progression.

- After you complete the main storyline (or if you've already completed it), you'll start to see merchants and pirates will sometimes be outfit with limited alien tech, and pirates in the occasional Military ship (Skein, Cruiser, Gunboat etc) in corresponding regions. You'll also start to see see alien tech fit Marauder fleets in the new missions as described above.

- After you complete the Kestrel missions (or if you've already completed them), you'll notice merchants and pirates start to appear in a wide range of Kestrel outfits, in the model that corresponds to your design choice in the Kestrel missions. This means if you choose weapons, you'll see 18 gun pirate Kestrels! Kestrels will also be seen occasionally in the missions described above.

- After you complete both main storyline and Kestrel missions (or if you've already completed them), you'll see the occasional limited alien fitted Kestrel, both in ambient merchant/pirate fleets, and in the missions described above.

- No other changes from vanilla are made.


## To test fully, use a pilot with the Kestrel missions completed and a combat rating of 12 or higher. Head to any Human space, and spam spaceport/check job board. Watch out for the new Bounty Hunter fleets coming to hunt you down!

It is designed to be quite difficult at times even for large-ish fleets so take care.

Please make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin.

Working on adding the following:

- More low-chance mission variants
- much more NPC ship/outfit combination variety
