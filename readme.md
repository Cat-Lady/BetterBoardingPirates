### This fork integrates Boarding Enhancements plugin content in the new pirate fleets (making them even harder to board).
# Better Vanilla Pirates for Endless Sky (requires 0.9.9 OR nightly build)

## Do you love vanilla ES everything but wish that the human pirates, bounty hunters and related combat missions (spaceport + job board), were a little more interesting, and stayed challenging with worthwhile mission payouts even in the late game?

This plugin is designed to enhance/improve/fill gaps in many aspects of pirate combat in Human space, especially in the late-game. It does not contain any new weapons/ships/sprites, or any new or replacement storylines, nor does it make the early game any harder. It achieves all this by the adding the following (POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW!)

- 30+ new combat missions (jobs and spaceport) with tonnes of variety and unusual low-chance variations in human space, complete with corresponding regional NPC assistance in many cases. These new missions include planetary defence, multiple wave planetary defence, nearby pirate blockade destruction and more. They range from 1mil to 20mil payouts, but the toughest jobs require extremely expensive fleets to complete without losses. Some of these involve gigantic fleet battles so take care!

- Many new variations of the "Marauder Hunted" mission, the "invisible" mission present in vanilla, where Marauder Bounty Hunters will occasionally hunt you down without warning if your combat rating is high enough. These new variations scale with combat rating, and come in two distinct flavours - small, homogeneous fleets of elite heavy warships with customised outfit combinations, and larger rag-tag fleets including all types of ships.

- Note that no existing missions/jobs are altered, just new ones are added. All new missions are repeating and can be declined with no penalty.

- Progressively introduces Hai+limited Korath exile outfits (heat shunts only), and the Kestrel, and then finally Hai/Korath fitted Kestrels, into ambient pirate/merchant fleets, mission targets (as  described above), and the Marauder Bounty Hunted fleet (that Marauder fleet that hunts you down occasionally if your combabt rating is high enough).

- Introduces pirates in ships they don't normally use, such as the Protector, Vanguard, Osprey, Aerie, Mule, in correct regions. Pirates in military ships including Dreadnought, Skein, Frigate, Gunboat are added after main story completion. You'll see these extremely rarely in ambient fleets and as mission targets.

- Additions described above that are based on storyline completion or Kestrel mission completion are applied retroactively. This means that you'll see all the changes on a save where you've completed these already, at least after you land once or twice post plugin install.

- *NEW* Now adds Korath Automata raid missions (spaceport) on certain Syndicate systems after the Korath Exiles start producing automata. Just like the Raider Attack missions in vanilla, just with Automata. You can now farm Sestor/Mereti ships post Wanderer storyline!

- Dozens of new pirate variants (new outfit combinations for existing ships).

- 18 Kestrel variants (6 for each Kestrel design choice) used in missions, bounty hunter/Marauder fleets, and in ambient Merchant/Pirate fleets.

## How does this actually change my game?

- With this plugin installed, your game will be completely vanilla everywhere early game, except you'll see pirates in more ships that they don't use in vanilla, like Aerie/Mule/Vanguard (no military ships yet).

- Once your combat rating gets past 9 (or if it is already), you'll start to see much more difficult combat jobs/spaceport missions, over 30 region specific variations, all over human space, vs new pirate fleet compositions. These missions start off with lots of enemy variety but will see more variation pirate ships and outfits as the main FW storyline and kestrel missions are completed, more detail on that below. The most difficult jobs also have low-chance variations with extra cool NPC assistance!

- As your combat rating continues to increase (up to a CR of 13), tougher and more varied Bounty Hunter fleets will hunt you down, and as above, these fleets become more varied with player progression. The spawn rate of these remains identical to vanilla. These fleets will keep you on your toes at all times in Human space, and force you to keep your combat and cargo/transport ships close or risk losing them. Tougher spaceport/job board missions will be unlocked at each combat rating from 8 to 12.

- After you complete the main FW storyline (or if you've already completed it), you'll start to see merchants and pirates will sometimes be outfit with limited alien tech, and pirates will sometimes be seen in Military ships (Skein, Cruiser, Gunboat etc) in corresponding regions. You'll also start to see alien tech fit Marauder fleets in the new missions as described above.

- After you complete the Kestrel missions (or if you've already completed them), you'll notice merchants and pirates start to occasionally appear in a wide range of Kestrel outfits, in the model that corresponds to your design choice in the Kestrel missions. This means if you choose weapons, you'll see 18 gun pirate Kestrels that actually use them all! Kestrels will also be seen occasionally in the missions described above.

- After you complete both the main FW storyline and Kestrel missions (or if you've already completed them), you'll see the occasional limited alien tech fitted Kestrel, both in ambient merchant/pirate fleets, and in the missions described above.

- Once you complete the Wanderer missions where the Korath Exiles begin using Sestor/Mereti automata as their own, some Syndicate systems will offer spaceport defence missions where the Korath are raiding the system with JD equipped automata! The payouts for these missions are relatively low, but they allow the player to obtain Sestor/Mereti ships after the Wanderer campaign (not possible in vanilla).

- No other changes from vanilla are made.


It is designed to be quite difficult at times even for large fleets so take care. You may find that human missiles become a serious problem in large numbers, with the large impact force capable of isolating and destroying your escorts with ease, anti-missile turrets may come in very handy!

Please make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin. The changes this plugin makes to fleets (adding pirates/merchants with Hai tech, adding pirate/merchant Kestrels, etc) are stored in your save file. If you remove the plugin, it may not work anymore. Backup your pilot file just in case you don't like this plugin.

Enjoy!
